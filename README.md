# NDVI-INDEX-Niger-Agadez
This graph shows the mean and annual variations of the NDVI index for the Agadez region in Niger. The data are extrapolated from the FAO METOP-AVHRR satellite and visualized using Rstudio. 
an explanation of The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be found on this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index#:~:text=The%20normalized%20difference%20vegetation%20index,observed%20contains%20live%20green%20vegetation.
I prepared this graph as a part of a monitoring and evaluation project looking to take trace of desertification process in Niger.
